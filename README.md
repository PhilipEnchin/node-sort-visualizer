**Note: This is in progress. Doesn't do much yet.**

Visualize Node's built-in sort from whatever Node version you like.

## Dependencies

To run this incredibly useful project, you've got two options:

1. Run on your own computer. You'll need [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed.
2. Run in Visual Studio Code inside the provided dev container. Get started with dev containers [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_getting-started).

## To test

```bash
./node-sorter.tests [node version]
```
For example:

./node-sorter.tests 4 # Runs using node version 4
```
